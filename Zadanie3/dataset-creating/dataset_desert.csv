Sherry wines are characterised by a distinctive, slightly oxidised flavour. They often contain hints of ripe apple, toasted nuts and salt. Fino and manzanilla, which age under a layer of flor yeast protecting them from oxygen, are light and dry with light floral and almond notes. Amontillado is an aged fino that has been further matured. Compared to fino, it is darker, richer and nuttier. Oloroso’s sweetness ranges from dry to medium, and it has nut, raisin and toasted flavours. Sweet cream sherries and Pedro Ximénez sherries are thick, syrupy and have caramel flavours.","Yellowy brown, tawny, medium-dry, ripe fruit notes, nutty, hint of almond, warm","Sherries have multiple uses from aperitifs to serving with appetisers and desserts, depending on the sherry type.  Fino is best served chilled from a freshly opened bottle, enjoyed as an aperitif, with savouries or tapas. You can also try fino with sushi. Amontillado is a good match for soups or broths. Brown, nutty, dry oloroso, aged for years in casks without a protective layer of flor, is a perfect match for hard aged cheeses or game and meat dishes with an intense flavour. Dark brown, caramelised cream sherry and Pedro Ximénez can be paired with nuts, dried fruit, ice cream and date cake, or on its own as a dessert."

Amontillado is an aged fino that has been further matured. Compared to fino, it is darker, richer and nuttier.

The spices in light, sweet vermouths are often softer and less bitter than in red, sweet vermouths.","Pale, light, sweet, vanilla notes, herbal notes, slightly bitter","Vermouth is used as an aperitif, for socialising and in mixed drinks. Light, dry and dryish vermouths are great aperitifs and can also be served on their own. They are also used as ingredients in many classic cocktails, such as Dry Martini. Many famous cocktails also include sweet vermouths: you cannot make a Negroni or Americano without red vermouth."

Amontillado is an aged fino that has been further matured. Compared to fino, it is darker, richer and nuttier.

It can contain dozens of spices. The exact recipe is often a secret. Vermouth is typically flavoured with wormwood extracts.  The colour ranges from light to red and the sweetness from dry to sweet. You can discern herbal, citrus, lightly bitter, spicy and frugal notes in vermouths. The spices in light, sweet vermouths are often softer and less bitter than in red, sweet vermouths.","Pale, light, dry, slightly fruity, herbal notes, spicy, light bitterness","Vermouth is used as an aperitif, for socialising and in mixed drinks. Light, dry and dryish vermouths are great aperitifs and can also be served on their own. They are also used as ingredients in many classic cocktails, such as Dry Martini. Many famous cocktails also include sweet vermouths: you cannot make a Negroni or Americano without red vermouth."

Dessert wines go best with fresh berry, fruit and cream desserts. Try dessert wines with cream pudding, white chocolate mousse, Crêpes Suzette, macarons or blue cheese."
